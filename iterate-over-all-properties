`own` props are defined directly on the object instance itself, while `prototype` props are defined on in the prototype method.

In this problem, add beagles ownProps as well as the prototype propertes to the array prototypeProps:



function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

let ownProps = [];
let prototypeProps = [];

// Only change code below this line

for (let property in beagle) {
  if(beagle.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  } else {
    prototypeProps.push(property);
  }
}
